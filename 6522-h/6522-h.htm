  <P>BID me and I shall gather my fruits to bring them in full baskets into your
  courtyard, though some are lost and some not ripe. </P>
  <P>For the season grows heavy with its fulness, and there is a plaintive
  shepherd's pipe in the shade. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
  <P>Bid me and I shall set sail on the river. </P>
  <P>The March wind is fretful, fretting the languid waves into murmurs. </P>
  <P>The garden has yielded its all, and in the weary hour of evening the call
  comes from your house on the shore in the sunset. </P><PRE>

  <P>MY life when young was like a flower--a flower that loosens a petal or two
  from her abundance and never feels the loss when the spring breeze comes to
  beg at her door. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
  <P>Now at the end of youth my life is like a fruit, having nothing to spare,
  and waiting to offer herself completely with her full burden of sweetness.
</P><PRE>

  <P>Is summer's festival only for fresh blossoms and not also for withered
  leaves and faded flowers? </P>
  <P>Is the song of the sea in tune only with the rising waves? </P>
  <P>Does it not also sing with the waves that fall? </P>
  <P>Jewels are woven into the carpet where stands my king, but there are
  patient clods waiting to be touched by his feet. </P>
  <P>Few are the wise and the great who sit by my Master, but he has taken the
  foolish in his arms and made me his servant for ever. </P><PRE>

  <P>I WOKE and found his letter with the morning. </P>
  <P>I do not know what it says, for I cannot read. </P>
  <P>I shall leave the wise man alone with his books, I shall not trouble him,
  for who knows if he can read what the letter says. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
  <P>Let me hold it to my forehead and press it to my heart. </P>
  <P>When the night grows still and stars come out one by one I will spread it
  on my lap and stay silent. </P>
  <P>The rustling leaves will read it aloud to me, the rushing stream will chant
  it, and the seven wise stars will sing it to me from the sky. </P><PB
  N="5"></PB>
  <P>I cannot find what I seek, I cannot understand what I would learn; but this
  unread letter has lightened my burdens and turned my thoughts into songs. </P><PRE>

  <P>A HANDFUL of dust could hide your signal when I did not know its meaning.
  </P>
  <P>Now that I am wiser I read it in all that hid it before. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
  <P>It is painted in petals of flowers; waves flash it from their foam; hills
  hold it high on their summits. </P>
  <P>I had my face turned from you, therefore I read the letters awry and knew
  not their meaning. </P><PRE>

  <P>WHERE roads are made I lose my way. </P>
  <P>In the wide water, in the blue sky there is no line of a track. </P>
  <P>The pathway is hidden by the birds' wings, by the star-fires, by the
  flowers of the wayfaring seasons. </P>
  <P>And I ask my heart if its blood carries the wisdom of the unseen way. </P><PRE>

  <H2>VII</H2></A>
  <P>ALAS, I cannot stay in the house, and home has become no home to me, for
  the eternal Stranger calls, he is going along the road. </P>
  <P>The sound of his footfall knocks at my breast; it pains me! </P>
  <P>The wind is up, the sea is moaning. I leave all my cares and doubts to
  follow the homeless tide, for the Stranger calls me, he is going along the
  road. </P><PRE>

  <P>BE ready to launch forth, my heart! and let those linger who must. </P>
  <P>For your name has been called in the morning sky. </P>
  <P>Wait for none! </P><PRE>
</PRE>
  <P>The desire of the bud is for the night and dew, but the blown flower cries
  for the freedom of light. </P>
  <P>Burst your sheath, my heart, and come forth! </P><PRE>

  <P>WHEN I lingered among my hoarded treasure I felt like a worm that feeds in
  the dark upon the fruit where it was born. </P>
  <P>I leave this prison of decay. </P>
  <P>I care not to haunt the mouldy stillness, for I go in search of everlasting
  youth; I throw away all that is not one with my life nor as light as my
  laughter. </P>
  <P>I run through time and, O my heart, in your chariot dances the poet who
  sings while he wanders. </P><PRE>

  <H2>X</H2></A>
  <P>You took my hand and drew me to your side, made me sit on the high seat
  before all men, till I became timid, unable to stir and walk my own way;
  doubting and debating at every step lest I should tread upon any thorn of
  their disfavour. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
  <P>I am freed at last! </P>
  <P>The blow has come, the drum of insult sounded, my seat is laid low in the
  dust. </P>
  <P>My paths are open before me. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
  <P>My wings are full of the desire of the sky. </P>
  <P>I go to join the shooting stars of midnight, to plunge into the profound
  shadow. </P><PB N="12"></PB>
  <P>I am like the storm-driven cloud of summer that, having cast off its crown
  of gold, hangs as a sword the thunderbolt upon a chain of lightning. </P>
  <P>In desperate joy I run upon the dusty path of the despised; I draw near to
  your final welcome. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
  <P>The child finds its mother when it leaves her womb. </P>
  <P>When I am parted from you, thrown out from your household, I am free to see
  your face. </P><PRE>

  <P>IT decks me only to mock me, this jewelled chain of mine. </P>
  <P>It bruises me when on my neck, it strangles me when I struggle to tear it
  off. </P>
  <P>It grips my throat, it chokes my singing. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
  <P>Could I but offer it to your hand, my Lord, I would be saved. </P>
  <P>Take it from me, and in exchange bind me to you with a garland, for I am
  ashamed to stand before you with this jewelled chain on my neck. </P><PRE>

  <P>FAR below flowed the Jumna, swift and clear, above frowned the jutting
  bank. </P>
  <P>Hills dark with the woods and scarred with the torrents were gathered
  around. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
  <P>Govinda, the great Sikh teacher, sat on the rock reading scriptures, when
  Raghunath, his disciple, proud of his wealth, came and bowed to him and said,
  "I have brought my poor present unworthy of your acceptance." </P><PRE>
</PRE>
  <P>Thus saying he displayed before the teacher a pair of gold bangles wrought
  with costly stones. </P>
  <P>The master took up one of them, <PB N="15"></PB>twirling it round his
  finger, and the diamonds darted shafts of light. </P>
  <P>Suddenly it slipped from his hand and rolled down the bank into the water.
  </P>
  <P>"Alas," screamed Raghunath, and jumped into the stream. </P>
  <P>The teacher set his eyes upon his book, and the water held and hid what it
  stole and went its way. </P>
  <P>The daylight faded when Raghunath came back to the teacher tired and
  dripping. </P>
  <P>He panted and said, "I can still get it back if you show me where it fell."
  </P>
  <P>The teacher took up the remaining bangle and throwing it into the water
  said, "It is there." </P><PRE>

  <P>To move is to meet you every
  moment,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fellow-traveller! </P>
  <P>It is to sing to the falling of your feet. </P>
  <P>He whom your breath touches does not glide by the shelter of the bank. </P>
  <P>He spreads a reckless sail to the wind and rides the turbulent water. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
  <P>He who throws his doors open and steps onward receives your greeting. </P>
  <P>He does not stay to count his gain or to mourn his loss; his heart beats
  the drum for his march, for that is to march with you every step, </P>

  <P>MY portion of the best in this world will come from your hands: such was
  your promise. </P>
  <P>Therefore your light glistens in my tears. </P>
  <P>I fear to be led by others lest I miss you waiting in some road corner to
  be my guide. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
  <P>I walk my own wilful way till my very folly tempts you to my door. </P>

  <P>YOUR speech is simple, my Master, but not theirs who talk of you. </P>
  <P>I understand the voice of your stars and the silence of your trees. </P>
  <P>I know that my heart would open like a flower; that my life has filled
  itself at a hidden fountain. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
  <P>Your songs, like birds from the lonely land of snow, are winging to build
  their nests in my heart against the warmth of its April, and I am content to
  wait for the merry season. </P><PRE>

  <P>THEY knew the way and went to seek you along the narrow lane, but I
  wandered abroad into the night for I was ignorant. </P>
  <P>I was not schooled enough to be afraid of you in the dark, therefore I came
  upon your doorstep unaware. </P>
  <P>The wise rebuked me and bade me be gone, for I had not come by the lane.
  </P>
  <P>I turned away in doubt, but you held me fast, and their scolding became
  louder every day. </P><PRE>

  <P>I BROUGHT out my earthen lamp from my house and cried, "Come, children, I
  will light your path!" </P><PRE>

  <P>The night was still dark when I returned, leaving the road to its silence,
  crying, "Light me, O Fire! for my earthen lamp lies broken in the dust!" </P><PRE>

  <P>No: it is not yours to open buds into blossoms. </P>
  <P>Shake the bud, strike it; it is beyond your power to make it blossom. </P>
  <P>Your touch soils it, you tear its petals to pieces and strew them in the
  dust. </P>
  <P>But no colours appear, and no perfume. </P>
  <P>Ah! it is not for you to open the bud into a blossom. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
  <P>He who can open the bud does it so simply. </P>
  <P>He gives it a glance, and the life-sap stirs through its veins. </P>
  <P>At his breath the flower spreads its wings and flutters in the wind.
  </P><PB N="22"></PB>
  <P>Colours flush out like heart-longings, the perfume betrays a sweet secret.

  <P>SUDÂS, the gardener, plucked from his tank the last lotus left by the
  ravage of winter and went to sell it to the king at the palace gate. </P>
  <P>There he met a traveller who said to him, "Ask your price for the last
  lotus,--I shall offer it to Lord Buddha." </P>
  <P>Sudâs said, "If you pay one golden <I>mâshâ</I> it will be yours." </P>
  <P>The traveller paid it. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
  <P>At that moment the king came out and he wished to buy the flower, for he
  was on his way to see Lord Buddha, and he thought, "It would be a fine thing
  to lay at his feet the lotus that bloomed in winter." </P>
  <P>When the gardener said he had been <PB N="24"></PB>offered a golden
  <I>mâshâ</I> the king offered him ten, but the traveller doubled the price.
  </P>
  <P>The gardener, being greedy, imagined a greater gain from him for whose sake
  they were bidding. He bowed and said, "I cannot sell this lotus." </P>
  <P>In the hushed shade of the mango grove beyond the city wall Sudâs stood
  before Lord Buddha, on whose lips sat the silence of love and whose eyes
  beamed peace like the morning star of the dew-washed autumn. </P>
  <P>Sudâs looked in his face and put the lotus at his feet and bowed his head
  to the dust. </P>
  <P>Buddha smiled and asked, "What is your wish, my son?" </P>
  <P>Sudâs cried, "The least touch of your feet." </P><PRE>

  <P>MAKE me thy poet, O Night, veiled Night! </P>
  <P>There are some who have sat speechless for ages in thy shadow; let me utter
  their songs. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
  <P>Take me up on thy chariot without wheels, running noiselessly from world to
  world, thou queen in the palace of time, thou darkly beautiful! </P><PRE>
</PRE>
  <P>Many a questioning mind has stealthily entered thy courtyard and roamed
  through thy lampless house seeking for answers. </P>
  <P>From many a heart, pierced with the arrow of joy from the hands of the
  Unknown, have burst forth glad <PB N="26"></PB>chants, shaking the darkness to
  its foundation. </P>
  <P>Those wakeful souls gaze in the starlight in wonder at the treasure they
  have suddenly found. </P>

  <P>I WILL meet one day the Life within me, the joy that hides in my life,
  though the days perplex my path with their idle dust. </P>
  <P>I have known it in glimpses, and its fitful breath has come upon me, making
  my thoughts fragrant for a while. </P>
  <P>I will meet one day the Joy without me that dwells behind the screen of
  light--and will stand in the overflowing solitude where all things are seen as
  by their creator. </P><PRE>

  <P>THIS autumn morning is tired with excess of light, and if your songs grow
  fitful and languid give me your flute awhile. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
  <P>I shall but play with it as the whim takes me,--now take it on my lap, now
  touch it with my lips, now keep it by my side on the grass. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
  <P>But in the solemn evening stillness I shall gather flowers, to deck it with
  wreaths, I shall fill it with fragrance; I shall worship it with the lighted
  lamp. </P>
  <P>Then at night I shall come to you and give you back your flute. </P>
  <P>You will play on it the music of midnight when the lonely crescent moon
  wanders among the stars. </P><PRE>

  <P>THE poet's mind floats and dances on the waves of life amidst the voices of
  wind and water. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
  <P>Now when the sun has set and the darkened sky draws upon the sea like
  drooping lashes upon a weary eye it is time to take away his pen, and let his

  <P>The hours wait, the stars watch, the wind is still, the silence is heavy in

  <P>THE bird of the morning sings. </P>
  <P>Whence has he word of the morning before the morning breaks, and when the
  dragon night still holds the sky in its cold black coils? </P><PRE>
</PRE>
  <P>Tell me, bird of the morning, how, through the twofold night of the sky and
  the leaves, he found his way into your dream, the messenger out of the east?
  </P>
  <P>The world did not believe you when you cried, "The sun is on his way, the
  night is no more." </P>
  <P>O sleeper, awake! </P>
  <P>Bare your forehead, waiting for the first blessing of light, and sing with
  the bird of the morning in glad faith. </P><PRE>

  <P>THE beggar in me lifted his lean hands to the starless sky and cried into
  night's ear with his hungry voice. </P>
  <P>His prayers were to the blind Darkness who lay like a fallen god in a
  desolate heaven of lost hopes. </P>
  <P>The cry of desire eddied round a chasm of despair, a wailing bird circling
  its empty nest. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
  <P>But when morning dropped anchor at the rim of the East, the beggar in me
  leapt and cried: </P>
  <P>"Blessed am I that the deaf night denied me--that its coffer was empty."
  </P>
  <P>He cried, "O Life, O Light, you are precious! and precious is the joy that
  at last has known you!" </P><PRE>

  <P>SANÂTAN was telling his beads by the Ganges when a Brahmin in rags came to
  him and said, "Help me, I am poor!" </P>
  <P>"My alms-bowl is all that is my own," said Sanâtan, "I have given away
  everything I had." </P>
  <P>"But my lord Shiva came to me in my dreams," said the Brahmin, "and
  counselled me to come to you." </P>
  <P>Sanâtan suddenly remembered he had picked up a stone without price among
  the pebbles on the river-bank, and thinking that some one might need it hid it
  in the sands. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
  <P>He pointed out the spot to the Brahmin, who wondering dug up the stone.
  </P><PB N="34"></PB>
  <P>The Brahmin sat on the earth and mused alone till the sun went down behind
  the trees, and cowherds went home with their cattle. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
  <P>Then he rose and came slowly to Sanâtan and said, "Master, give me the
  least fraction of the wealth that disdains all the wealth of the world." </P>
  <P>And he threw the precious stone into the water. </P><PRE>

  <P>TIME after time I came to your gate with raised hands, asking for more and
  yet more. </P>
  <P>You gave and gave, now in slow measure, now in sudden excess. </P>
  <P>I took some, and some things I let drop; some lay heavy on my hands; some I
  made into playthings and broke them when tired; till the wrecks and the hoard
  of your gifts grew immense, hiding you, and the ceaseless expectation wore my
  heart out. </P>
  <P>Take, oh take--has now become my cry. </P>
  <P>Shatter all from this beggar's bowl: put out this lamp of the importunate
  watcher: hold my hands, raise me from the still-gathering heap of your gifts
  into the bare infinity of your uncrowded presence. </P><PRE>

  <P>YOU have set me among those who are defeated. </P>

  <P>I shall plunge into the pool although but to sink to the bottom. </P>
  <P>I shall play the game of my undoing. </P><PRE>

  <P>A SMILE of mirth spread over the sky when you dressed my heart in rags and
  sent her forth into the road to beg. </P>
  <P>She went from door to door, and many a time when her bowl was nearly full
  she was robbed. </P><PRE>

  <P>The autumn day was dying. The evening hour of worship was near. </P>
  <P>Shrimati, the queen's maid, devoted to Lord Buddha, having bathed in holy

  <P>THE sun had set on the western margin of the river among the tangle of the

  <P>The hermit boys had brought the cattle home, and sat round the fire to
  listen to the master, Guatama, when a strange boy came, and greeted him with
  fruits and flowers, and, bowing low at his feet, spoke in a bird-like

  Truth. </P>
  <P>"My name is Satyakâma." </P><PRE>

  <P>Thus saying, Satyak&amp;acric;ma took leave, and wading across the shallow
  stream, came back to his mother's hut, which stood at the end of the sandy
  waste at the edge of the sleeping village. </P>
  <P>The lamp burnt dimly in the room, and the mother stood at the door in the
  dark waiting for her son's return. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
  <P>She clasped him to her bosom, kissed him on his hair, and asked him of his

  <P>"What is the name of my father, dear mother?" asked the boy. </P>

  <P>There came Satyakâma. </P>
  <P>He bowed low at the feet of the sage, and stood silent. </P>
  <P>"Tell me," the great teacher asked him, "of what clan art thou?" </P>
  <P>"My lord," he answered, "I know it not. My mother said when I asked her, 'I
  had served many masters in my youth, and thou hadst come to thy mother
  Jabâlâ's arms, who had no husband.'" </P><PB N="91"></PB>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
